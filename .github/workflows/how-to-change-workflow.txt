Changing the yml workflow file does not work for me.

Neither manually editing the node.js.yml file online,
nor committing changes will change the yml workflow file.

I seems to me that the file is made once, and then cached.

To signal a new file change the versions as they are consol logged.
  - uses: actions/checkout@v2
  - uses: actions/checkout@v3


Workflow can be disabled.
